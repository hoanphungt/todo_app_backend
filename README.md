# TODO App - Backend

## Description

This is the backend for a TODO application to show a list of todo items.
The frontend can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/hoanphungt/todo_app_frontend).

## Technology

- Elixir: The programming language https://elixir-lang.org/
- Phoenix: Web framework in Elixir http://www.phoenixframework.org/
- Absinthe: GraphQL implementation for Elixir that will handle running GraphQL queries submitted via Phoenix http://absinthe-graphql.org/

## Installation and usage

To start your Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/graphiql`](http://localhost:4000/graphiql) from your browser to interact with the server.

## Test

- Run `mix test` to run the tests
